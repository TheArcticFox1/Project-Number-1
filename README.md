<h1> A brief History of World War II</h1>

As our first Portfolio-1 Project suggested students to create a website with an Historical content, 

I decided to create an informative website that describes and highlights some of the Major events that occurred during World War II from 1939 to 1945.

I chose this topic as it is a highly significant event in the History of Mankind and it is also a very appropriate historical event topic that had far reaching consequences for Mankind and the world for decades and beyond.
